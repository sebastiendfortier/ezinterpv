VERTICAL INTERPOLATION PACKAGE 
 
LAYOUT OF THE SOFTWARE: 
The heart of the software consists of two classes:  the verticalInterpolation class where the interpolation is actually performed (using the 1-D library), and the verticalGrid class which defines the co-ordinates for the interpolation and is input for the verticalInterpolation class.
 
Finally, there is the VerticalInterpolationConstants module (in the
file, VertInterpConstants.cdk90) which groups together constants of the package, including error codes.
 
For more information, see the HTML introduction and F90 program example.
